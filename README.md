Implementation of AssemblySolidity's grammar with antlr 4.5 and based of [Assembly](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/assembly.html?highlight=assembly#parsing-grammar).

The grammar doesn't validate building please, you use solc to build and to validate. The grammar was designed to analyse code 

The grammar used the test of case [Solidity-Assembly](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/assembly.html?highlight=assembly#solidity-assembly).
